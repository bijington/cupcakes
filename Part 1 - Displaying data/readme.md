# Part 1 - Displaying data

In this part we will be adding the first page into our application and making it show some data.

## Setup

We have a few steps to follow but one key detail to highlight is that we will be creating a top-level folder for each part of our application (e.g. Customers, Products, etc.).

Let's make the following changes:

* Add a new folder to the root of the project and call it `Customers`.
* Inside the new `Customers` folder create a new folder and call it `Pages`.
* Add a new `ContentPage` inside the `Pages` folder and call it `CustomersPage`.
* Delete the `MainPage.xaml` file that was created by default.
