# .NET MAUI - Workshop

The purpose of this workshop is to develop a small cross-platform app using .NET MAUI together. Using an end-to-end example, we will learn how to build simple screens with .NET MAUI, display data in lists, retrieve data from external sources and make full use of the framework to keep our codebase simple.

This workshop takes inspiration from the [.NET MAUI Workshop](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/dotnet-maui-workshop).

## Setup Guide

This workshop is intended to be a hands on guide that you can follow along with on your own device. You can develop on PC or Mac and all you will need to do is install Visual Studio 2022, Visual Studio Code or Rider with the .NET MAUI workload. It is built on .NET 8, which means you will need version 17.9 of Visual Studio 2022 or newer. See [full installation guide for .NET MAUI](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/get-started/installation?view=net-maui-8.0) for more information. Note that during the creation of this application and workshop I personally used Rider, it has been my first real experience with the IDE but if you are able to invest in the tooling then I would recommend it.

Before starting the workshop, I recommend going through the quick 10 minute [.NET MAUI Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/get-started/first-app?WT.mc_id=friends-mauiworkshop-jamont) that will guide you through installation and also ensuring everything is configured correct.

If you are new to mobile development, we recommend deploying to a physical Android device which can be setup in just a few steps. If you don't have a device, don't worry as you can setup an [Android emulator with hardware acceleration](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/android/get-started/installation/android-emulator?WT.mc_id=friends-mauiworkshop-jamont). If you don't have time to set this up ahead of time, don't worry as we are here to help during the workshop.

Beyond that you will be good to go for the workshop!
